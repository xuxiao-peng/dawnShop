-################################## NETWORK #####################################
-
-# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
-# for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.
-# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
-# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
-#
-# Examples:
-#
-# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
-# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
-#
-# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
-# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
-# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
-# following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into
-# the IPv4 lookback interface address (this means Redis will be able to
-# accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it
-# is running).
-#
-# IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
-# JUST COMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
-# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-bind 127.0.0.1
-
-# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
-# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.

-# When protected mode is on and if:
-#
-# 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
-#    "bind" directive.
-# 2) No password is configured.
-#
-# The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
-# IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
-# sockets.
-#
-# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
-# you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
-# even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
-# are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.

-#    equipment in the middle.

-# On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
-# Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.

-################################# REPLICATION #################################
-
-# Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of
-# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
-#
-# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
-#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
-#    a given number of slaves.
-# 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
-#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
-#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
-#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
-# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
-#    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters
-#    and resynchronize with them.
-#
-# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>
-
-# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
-# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before
-# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
-# refuse the slave request.
-#
-# masterauth <master-password>
-
-# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
-# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:
-#
-# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will
-#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
-#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
-#
-# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with
-#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
-#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.
-#
-slave-serve-stale-data yes
-
-# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
-# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
-# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
-# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
-# misconfiguration.
-#
-# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.
-#
-# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
-# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
-# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands
-# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
-# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
-# administrative / dangerous commands.
-slave-read-only yes
-
-# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
-#
-# -------------------------------------------------------
-# WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY
-# -------------------------------------------------------
-#
-# New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication
-# process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full
-# synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.
-# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
-#
-# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
-#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
-#                 process to the slaves incrementally.
-# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
-#              RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.
-#
-# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves
-# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing
-# the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once
-# the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer
-# will start when the current one terminates.
-#
-# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
-# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves
-# will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
-#
-# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
-# works better.
-repl-diskless-sync no
-
-# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
-# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
-# to the slaves.
-#
-# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
-# new slaves arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server
-# waits a delay in order to let more slaves arrive.
-#
-# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
-# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
-repl-diskless-sync-delay 5
-
-# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
-# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10
-# seconds.
-#
-# repl-ping-slave-period 10
-
-# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
-#
-# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of slave.
-# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of slaves (data, pings).
-# 3) Slave timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
-#
-# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
-# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
-# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.
-#
-# repl-timeout 60
-
-# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?
-#
-# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
-# less bandwidth to send data to slaves. But this can add a delay for
-# the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with
-# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
-#
-# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the slave side will
-# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
-#
-# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
-# or when the master and slaves are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
-# be a good idea.
-repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no
-
-# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
-# slave data when slaves are disconnected for some time, so that when a slave
-# wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial
-# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while
-# disconnected.
-#
-# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the slave can be
-# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
-#
-# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a slave connected.
-#
-# repl-backlog-size 1mb
-
-# After a master has no longer connected slaves for some time, the backlog
-# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
-# need to elapse, starting from the time the last slave disconnected, for
-# the backlog buffer to be freed.
-#
-# Note that slaves never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be
-# promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly "partially
-# resynchronize" with the slaves: hence they should always accumulate backlog.
-#
-# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
-#
-# repl-backlog-ttl 3600
-
-# The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.
-# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a
-# master if the master is no longer working correctly.
-#
-# A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
-# for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
-# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
-#
-# However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the
-# role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by
-# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
-#
-# By default the priority is 100.
-slave-priority 100
-
-# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
-# N slaves connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
-#
-# The N slaves need to be in "online" state.
-#
-# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
-# the last ping received from the slave, that is usually sent every second.
-#
-# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
-# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough slaves
-# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
-#
-# For example to require at least 3 slaves with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
-#
-# min-slaves-to-write 3
-# min-slaves-max-lag 10
-#
-# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
-#
-# By default min-slaves-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
-# min-slaves-max-lag is set to 10.
-
-# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
-# slaves in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
-# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
-# Redis Sentinel in order to discover slave instances.
-# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
-# "ROLE" command of a master.
-#
-# The listed IP and address normally reported by a slave is obtained
-# in the following way:
-#
-#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
-#   of the socket used by the slave to connect with the master.
-#
-#   Port: The port is communicated by the slave during the replication
-#   handshake, and is normally the port that the slave is using to
-#   list for connections.
-#
-# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
-# used, the slave may be actually reachable via different IP and port
-# pairs. The following two options can be used by a slave in order to
-# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
-# and ROLE will report those values.

-# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
-#
-# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending
-# an error 'max number of clients reached'.
-#
-# maxclients 10000
-
-############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################
-
-# Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.
-# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
-# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
-#
-# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
-# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
-# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
-# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
-#
-# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to
-# set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
-#
-# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
-# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted
-# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
-# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
-# buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
-# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
-#
-# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower
-# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave
-# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
-#
-# maxmemory <bytes>
-
-# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
-# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
-#
-# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU among the keys with an expire set.
-# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
-# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU among the keys with an expire set.
-# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
-# volatile-random -> Remove a random key among the ones with an expire set.
-# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
-# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
-# noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
-#
-# LRU means Least Recently Used
-# LFU means Least Frequently Used
-#
-# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
-# randomized algorithms.
-#
-# Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write
-#       operations, when there are no suitable keys for eviction.
-#
-#       At the date of writing these commands are: set setnx setex append
-#       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd
-#       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby
-#       zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby
-#       getset mset msetnx exec sort
-#
-# The default is:
-#
-# maxmemory-policy noeviction
-
-# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
-# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
-# accuracy. For default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
-# used less recently, you can change the sample size using the following
-# configuration directive.
-#
-# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
-# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.
-#
-# maxmemory-samples 5

-############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################
-
-# Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking
-# deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands
-# in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous
-# way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed
-# in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other
-# O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an
-# aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for
-# a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.
-#
-# For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives
-# such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and
-# FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands
-# are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the
-# object in the background as fast as possible.
-#
-# DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.
-# It's up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good
-# idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to
-# delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.
-# Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the
-# following scenarios:
-#
-# 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,
-#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified
-#    memory limit.
-# 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the
-#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.
-# 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may
-#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key
-#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE
-#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command
-#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace
-#    it with the specified string.
-# 4) During replication, when a slave performs a full resynchronization with
-#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to
-#    load the RDB file just transfered.
-#
-# In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,
-# like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically
-# in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK
-# was called, using the following configuration directives:
-
-lazyfree-lazy-eviction no
-lazyfree-lazy-expire no
-lazyfree-lazy-server-del no
-slave-lazy-flush no

-############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################
-
-# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
-# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
-# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
-# the configured save points).
-#
-# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
-# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
-# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
-# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
-# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
-# still running correctly.
-#
-# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
-# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
-# with the better durability guarantees.
-#
-# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.
-
-appendonly no
-
-# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")
-
-appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
-
-# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
-# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
-# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
-#
-# Redis supports three different modes:
-#
-# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
-# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
-# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
-#
-# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
-# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
-# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
-# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
-# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
-# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
-# everysec.
-#
-# More details please check the following article:
-# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
-#
-# If unsure, use "everysec".
-
-# appendfsync always
-appendfsync everysec
-# appendfsync no
-
-# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
-# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
-# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
-# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
-# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
-# our synchronous write(2) call.
-#
-# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
-# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
-# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
-#
-# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
-# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
-# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
-# default Linux settings).
-#
-# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
-# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

-no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no
-
-# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
-# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
-# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
-#
-# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
-# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
-# the AOF at startup is used).
-#
-# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
-# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
-# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
-# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
-# is reached but it is still pretty small.
-#
-# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
-# rewrite feature.
-
-auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
-auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb
-
-# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
-# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
-# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
-# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
-# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
-# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
-#
-# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
-# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
-# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
-#
-# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
-# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
-# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
-# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
-# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
-# the server.
-#
-# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
-# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
-# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
-# will be found.
-aof-load-truncated yes
-
-# When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the
-# AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned
-# on the rewritten AOF file is composed of two different stanzas:
-#
-#   [RDB file][AOF tail]
-#
-# When loading Redis recognizes that the AOF file starts with the "REDIS"
-# string and loads the prefixed RDB file, and continues loading the AOF
-# tail.
-#
-# This is currently turned off by default in order to avoid the surprise
-# of a format change, but will at some point be used as the default.

-# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-# WARNING EXPERIMENTAL: Redis Cluster is considered to be stable code, however
-# in order to mark it as "mature" we need to wait for a non trivial percentage
-# of users to deploy it in production.
-# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-#
-# Normal Redis instances can't be part of a Redis Cluster; only nodes that are
-# started as cluster nodes can. In order to start a Redis instance as a
-# cluster node enable the cluster support uncommenting the following:
-#
-# cluster-enabled yes
-
-# Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not
-# intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.
-# Every Redis Cluster node requires a different cluster configuration file.
-# Make sure that instances running in the same system do not have
-# overlapping cluster configuration file names.
-#
-# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf
-
-# Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable
-# for it to be considered in failure state.
-# Most other internal time limits are multiple of the node timeout.
-#
-# cluster-node-timeout 15000
-
-# A slave of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
-# looks too old.
-#
-# There is no simple way for a slave to actually have an exact measure of
-# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
-#
-# 1) If there are multiple slaves able to failover, they exchange messages
-#    in order to try to give an advantage to the slave with the best
-#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
-#    Slaves will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
-#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
-#
-# 2) Every single slave computes the time of the last interaction with
-#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
-#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
-#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
-#    If the last interaction is too old, the slave will not try to failover
-#    at all.
-#
-# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a slave will not perform
-# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
-# elapsed is greater than:
-#
-#   (node-timeout * slave-validity-factor) + repl-ping-slave-period
-#
-# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the slave-validity-factor
-# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-slave-period of 10 seconds, the
-# slave will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
-# for longer than 310 seconds.
-#
-# A large slave-validity-factor may allow slaves with too old data to failover
-# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
-# elect a slave at all.
-#
-# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the slave-validity-factor
-# to a value of 0, which means, that slaves will always try to failover the
-# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
-# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
-# offset rank).
-#
-# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
-# the cluster will always be able to continue.
-#
-# cluster-slave-validity-factor 10
-
-# Cluster slaves are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
-# that are left without working slaves. This improves the cluster ability
-# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
-# in case of failure if it has no working slaves.
-#
-# Slaves migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
-# given number of other working slaves for their old master. This number
-# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a slave
-# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working slave for its master
-# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of slaves you want for every
-# master in your cluster.
-#
-# Default is 1 (slaves migrate only if their masters remain with at least
-# one slave). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.
-# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
-# in production.
-#
-# cluster-migration-barrier 1
-
-# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
-# is at least an hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
-# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
-# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
-# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
-#
-# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
-# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
-# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
-# option to no.
-#
-# cluster-require-full-coverage yes
-
-# This option, when set to yes, prevents slaves from trying to failover its
-# master during master failures. However the master can still perform a
-# manual failover, if forced to do so.
-#
-# This is useful in different scenarios, especially in the case of multiple
-# data center operations, where we want one side to never be promoted if not
-# in the case of a total DC failure.
-#
-# cluster-slave-no-failover no

-########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################
-
-# In certain deployments, Redis Cluster nodes address discovery fails, because
-# addresses are NAT-ted or because ports are forwarded (the typical case is
-# Docker and other containers).
-#
-# In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static
-# configuration where each node knows its public address is needed. The
-# following two options are used for this scope, and are:
-#
-# * cluster-announce-ip
-# * cluster-announce-port
-# * cluster-announce-bus-port
-#
-# Each instruct the node about its address, client port, and cluster message
-# bus port. The information is then published in the header of the bus packets
-# so that other nodes will be able to correctly map the address of the node
-# publishing the information.
-#
-# If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection
-# will be used instead.
-#
-# Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of
-# clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending
-# on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of
-# 10000 will be used as usually.
-#
-# Example:
-#
-# cluster-announce-ip 10.1.1.5
-# cluster-announce-port 6379
-# cluster-announce-bus-port 6380
-
-################################## SLOW LOG ###################################
-
-# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
-# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
-# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
-# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
-# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
-# other requests in the meantime).
-#
-# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
-# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
-# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
-# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
-# queue of logged commands.
-
-# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
-# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
-# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
-slowlog-log-slower-than 10000
-
-# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
-# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.

-################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################
-
-# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
-# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
-# latency of a Redis instance.
-#
-# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
-# print graphs and obtain reports.
-#
-# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
-# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
-# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
-# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
-#
-# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
-# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
-# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
-# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
-# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.
-latency-monitor-threshold 0
-
-############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################
-
-# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
-# This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications
-#
-# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
-# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
-# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
-#
-# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
-# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
-#
-# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
-# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
-#
-#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
-#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
-#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
-#  $     String commands
-#  l     List commands
-#  s     Set commands
-#  h     Hash commands
-#  z     Sorted set commands
-#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
-#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
-#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the "AKE" string means all the events.
-#
-#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
-#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
-#  are disabled.
-#
-#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
-#           event name, use:
-#
-#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
-#
-#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
-#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
-#
-#  notify-keyspace-events Ex
-#
-#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
-#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
-#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.

-############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################

-# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a
-# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given
-# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.
-hash-max-ziplist-entries 512
-hash-max-ziplist-value 64
-
-# Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.
-# The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified

-# -4: max size: 32 Kb  <-- not recommended
-# -3: max size: 16 Kb  <-- probably not recommended
-# -2: max size: 8 Kb   <-- good
-# -1: max size: 4 Kb   <-- good
-# Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements

-# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
-# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
-# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)
-# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
-# that is rehashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
-# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
-# by the hash table.
-#
-# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
-# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
-#
-# If unsure:
-# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
-# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
-# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
-#
-# use "activerehashing yes" if you don't have such hard requirements but
-# want to free memory asap when possible.

-# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
-# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
-# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
-# publisher can produce them).
-#
-# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
-#
-# normal -> normal clients including MONITOR clients
-# slave  -> slave clients
-# pubsub -> clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
-#
-# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
-#
-# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>
-#
-# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
-# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
-# seconds (continuously).
-# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
-# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
-# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
-# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
-# the limit for 10 seconds.
-#
-# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
-# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
-# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
-# than it can read.
-#
-# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since
-# subscribers and slaves receive data in a push fashion.
-#
-# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.

-# Client query buffers accumulate new commands. They are limited to a fixed
-# amount by default in order to avoid that a protocol desynchronization (for

-
-# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like
-# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are
-# never requested, and so forth.
-#
-# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for
-# tasks to perform according to the specified "hz" value.
-#
-# By default "hz" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when
-# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when
-# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be
-# handled with more precision.
-#
-# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not

-# Redis LFU eviction (see maxmemory setting) can be tuned. However it is a good
-# idea to start with the default settings and only change them after investigating
-# how to improve the performances and how the keys LFU change over time, which
-# is possible to inspect via the OBJECT FREQ command.
-#
-# There are two tunable parameters in the Redis LFU implementation: the
-# counter logarithm factor and the counter decay time. It is important to
-# understand what the two parameters mean before changing them.
-#
-# The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it's maximum value is 255, so Redis
-# uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value
-# of the old counter, when a key is accessed, the counter is incremented in
-# this way:
-#
-# 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.
-# 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).
-# 3. The counter is incremented only if R < P.
-#
-# The default lfu-log-factor is 10. This is a table of how the frequency
-# counter changes with a different number of accesses with different
-# logarithmic factors:
-#
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | factor | 100 hits   | 1000 hits  | 100K hits  | 1M hits    | 10M hits   |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | 0      | 104        | 255        | 255        | 255        | 255        |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | 1      | 18         | 49         | 255        | 255        | 255        |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | 10     | 10         | 18         | 142        | 255        | 255        |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | 100    | 8          | 11         | 49         | 143        | 255        |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+

-# NOTE: The above table was obtained by running the following commands:

-#
-# The counter decay time is the time, in minutes, that must elapse in order
-# for the key counter to be divided by two (or decremented if it has a value

-########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################
-#
-# WARNING THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL. However it was stress tested
-# even in production and manually tested by multiple engineers for some
-# time.
-#
-# What is active defragmentation?
-# -------------------------------
-#
-# Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the
-# spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,
-# thus allowing to reclaim back memory.
-#
-# Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but
-# less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server
-# restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush
-# away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature
-# implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime
-# in an "hot" way, while the server is running.
-#
-# Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the
-# configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the
-# values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc
-# features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation
-# and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the
-# old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys
-# will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.
-#
-# Important things to understand:
-#
-# 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis
-#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.
-#    This is the default with Linux builds.
-#
-# 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don't have fragmentation
-#    issues.
-#
-# 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when
-#    needed with the command "CONFIG SET activedefrag yes".
-#
-# The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the
-# defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is
-# a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.
-
-# Enabled active defragmentation
-# activedefrag yes

-# Minimum amount of fragmentation waste to start active defrag
-# active-defrag-ignore-bytes 100mb
-
-# Minimum percentage of fragmentation to start active defrag
-# active-defrag-threshold-lower 10
-
-# Maximum percentage of fragmentation at which we use maximum effort
-# active-defrag-threshold-upper 100

-;                          because CPU calculation is done when the request
-;                          processing has terminated;
-;   last request memory  - the max amount of memory the last request consumed
-;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state
-;                          because memory calculation is done when the request
-;                          processing has terminated;

-;   last request cpu     - the %cpu the last request consumed
-;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state
-;                          because CPU calculation is done when the request
-;                          processing has terminated;
-;   last request memory  - the max amount of memory the last request consumed
-;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state
-;                          because memory calculation is done when the request
-;                          processing has terminated;

-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; About php.ini   ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; PHP's initialization file, generally called php.ini, is responsible for
-; configuring many of the aspects of PHP's behavior.
-
-; PHP attempts to find and load this configuration from a number of locations.
-; The following is a summary of its search order:
-; 1. SAPI module specific location.
-; 2. The PHPRC environment variable. (As of PHP 5.2.0)
-; 3. A number of predefined registry keys on Windows (As of PHP 5.2.0)
-; 4. Current working directory (except CLI)
-; 5. The web server's directory (for SAPI modules), or directory of PHP
-; (otherwise in Windows)
-; 6. The directory from the --with-config-file-path compile time option, or the
-; Windows directory (C:\windows or C:\winnt)
-; See the PHP docs for more specific information.
-; http://php.net/configuration.file
-
-; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and lines
-; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).
-; Section headers (e.g. [Foo]) are also silently ignored, even though
-; they might mean something in the future.
-
-; Directives following the section heading [PATH=/www/mysite] only
-; apply to PHP files in the /www/mysite directory.  Directives
-; following the section heading [HOST=www.example.com] only apply to
-; PHP files served from www.example.com.  Directives set in these
-; special sections cannot be overridden by user-defined INI files or
-; at runtime. Currently, [PATH=] and [HOST=] sections only work under
-; CGI/FastCGI.
-; http://php.net/ini.sections
-
-; Directives are specified using the following syntax:
-; directive = value
-; Directive names are *case sensitive* - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.
-; Directives are variables used to configure PHP or PHP extensions.
-; There is no name validation.  If PHP can't find an expected
-; directive because it is not set or is mistyped, a default value will be used.
-
-; The value can be a string, a number, a PHP constant (e.g. E_ALL or M_PI), one
-; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None) or an expression
-; (e.g. E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE), a quoted string ("bar"), or a reference to a
-; previously set variable or directive (e.g. ${foo})
-
-; Expressions in the INI file are limited to bitwise operators and parentheses:
-; |  bitwise OR
-; ^  bitwise XOR
-; &  bitwise AND
-; ~  bitwise NOT
-; !  boolean NOT
-
-; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes.
-; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No.
-
-; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal
-; sign, or by using the None keyword:
-
-;  foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string
-;  foo = None    ; sets foo to an empty string
-;  foo = "None"  ; sets foo to the string 'None'
-
-; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a
-; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension),
-; you may only use these constants *after* the line that loads the extension.
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; About this file ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; PHP comes packaged with two INI files. One that is recommended to be used
-; in production environments and one that is recommended to be used in
-; development environments.
-
-; php.ini-production contains settings which hold security, performance and
-; best practices at its core. But please be aware, these settings may break
-; compatibility with older or less security conscience applications. We
-; recommending using the production ini in production and testing environments.
-
-; php.ini-development is very similar to its production variant, except it's
-; much more verbose when it comes to errors. We recommending using the
-; development version only in development environments as errors shown to
-; application users can inadvertently leak otherwise secure information.
-
-; This is php.ini-production INI file.
-
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; Quick Reference ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; The following are all the settings which are different in either the production
-; or development versions of the INIs with respect to PHP's default behavior.
-; Please see the actual settings later in the document for more details as to why
-; we recommend these changes in PHP's behavior.

-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-; Language Options ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-
-; Enable the PHP scripting language engine under Apache.
-; http://php.net/engine
-engine = On
-
-; This directive determines whether or not PHP will recognize code between
-; <? and ?> tags as PHP source which should be processed as such. It is
-; generally recommended that <?php and ?> should be used and that this feature
-; should be disabled, as enabling it may result in issues when generating XML
-; documents, however this remains supported for backward compatibility reasons.
-; Note that this directive does not control the <?= shorthand tag, which can be
-; used regardless of this directive.
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: Off
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/short-open-tag
-short_open_tag = On
-
-; Allow ASP-style <% %> tags.
-; http://php.net/asp-tags

-; The number of significant digits displayed in floating point numbers.
-; http://php.net/precision
-precision = 14
-
-; Output buffering is a mechanism for controlling how much output data
-; (excluding headers and cookies) PHP should keep internally before pushing that
-; data to the client. If your application's output exceeds this setting, PHP
-; will send that data in chunks of roughly the size you specify.
-; Turning on this setting and managing its maximum buffer size can yield some
-; interesting side-effects depending on your application and web server.
-; You may be able to send headers and cookies after you've already sent output
-; through print or echo. You also may see performance benefits if your server is
-; emitting less packets due to buffered output versus PHP streaming the output
-; as it gets it. On production servers, 4096 bytes is a good setting for performance
-; reasons.
-; Note: Output buffering can also be controlled via Output Buffering Control
-;   functions.
-; Possible Values:
-;   On = Enabled and buffer is unlimited. (Use with caution)
-;   Off = Disabled
-;   Integer = Enables the buffer and sets its maximum size in bytes.
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI
-; Default Value: Off
-; Development Value: 4096
-; Production Value: 4096
-; http://php.net/output-buffering
-output_buffering = 4096
-
-; You can redirect all of the output of your scripts to a function.  For
-; example, if you set output_handler to "mb_output_handler", character
-; encoding will be transparently converted to the specified encoding.
-; Setting any output handler automatically turns on output buffering.
-; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini
-;   directive. Instead, explicitly set the output handler using ob_start().
-;   Using this ini directive may cause problems unless you know what script
-;   is doing.
-; Note: You cannot use both "mb_output_handler" with "ob_iconv_handler"
-;   and you cannot use both "ob_gzhandler" and "zlib.output_compression".
-; Note: output_handler must be empty if this is set 'On' !!!!
-;   Instead you must use zlib.output_handler.
-; http://php.net/output-handler
-;output_handler =
-
-; Transparent output compression using the zlib library
-; Valid values for this option are 'off', 'on', or a specific buffer size
-; to be used for compression (default is 4KB)
-; Note: Resulting chunk size may vary due to nature of compression. PHP
-;   outputs chunks that are few hundreds bytes each as a result of
-;   compression. If you prefer a larger chunk size for better
-;   performance, enable output_buffering in addition.
-; Note: You need to use zlib.output_handler instead of the standard
-;   output_handler, or otherwise the output will be corrupted.
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-compression
-zlib.output_compression = Off
-
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-compression-level
-;zlib.output_compression_level = -1
-
-; You cannot specify additional output handlers if zlib.output_compression
-; is activated here. This setting does the same as output_handler but in
-; a different order.
-; http://php.net/zlib.output-handler
-;zlib.output_handler =
-
-; Implicit flush tells PHP to tell the output layer to flush itself
-; automatically after every output block.  This is equivalent to calling the
-; PHP function flush() after each and every call to print() or echo() and each
-; and every HTML block.  Turning this option on has serious performance
-; implications and is generally recommended for debugging purposes only.
-; http://php.net/implicit-flush
-; Note: This directive is hardcoded to On for the CLI SAPI
-implicit_flush = Off
-
-; The unserialize callback function will be called (with the undefined class'
-; name as parameter), if the unserializer finds an undefined class
-; which should be instantiated. A warning appears if the specified function is
-; not defined, or if the function doesn't include/implement the missing class.
-; So only set this entry, if you really want to implement such a
-; callback-function.
-unserialize_callback_func =
-
-; When floats & doubles are serialized store serialize_precision significant
-; digits after the floating point. The default value ensures that when floats
-; are decoded with unserialize, the data will remain the same.
-serialize_precision = 17
-
-; open_basedir, if set, limits all file operations to the defined directory

-; Error handling and logging ;
-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
-
-; This directive informs PHP of which errors, warnings and notices you would like
-; it to take action for. The recommended way of setting values for this
-; directive is through the use of the error level constants and bitwise
-; operators. The error level constants are below here for convenience as well as
-; some common settings and their meanings.
-; By default, PHP is set to take action on all errors, notices and warnings EXCEPT
-; those related to E_NOTICE and E_STRICT, which together cover best practices and
-; recommended coding standards in PHP. For performance reasons, this is the
-; recommend error reporting setting. Your production server shouldn't be wasting
-; resources complaining about best practices and coding standards. That's what
-; development servers and development settings are for.
-; Note: The php.ini-development file has this setting as E_ALL. This
-; means it pretty much reports everything which is exactly what you want during
-; development and early testing.
-;
-; Error Level Constants:
-; E_ALL             - All errors and warnings (includes E_STRICT as of PHP 5.4.0)
-; E_ERROR           - fatal run-time errors
-; E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR  - almost fatal run-time errors
-; E_WARNING         - run-time warnings (non-fatal errors)
-; E_PARSE           - compile-time parse errors
-; E_NOTICE          - run-time notices (these are warnings which often result
-;                     from a bug in your code, but it's possible that it was
-;                     intentional (e.g., using an uninitialized variable and
-;                     relying on the fact it's automatically initialized to an
-;                     empty string)
-; E_STRICT          - run-time notices, enable to have PHP suggest changes
-;                     to your code which will ensure the best interoperability
-;                     and forward compatibility of your code
-; E_CORE_ERROR      - fatal errors that occur during PHP's initial startup
-; E_CORE_WARNING    - warnings (non-fatal errors) that occur during PHP's
-;                     initial startup
-; E_COMPILE_ERROR   - fatal compile-time errors
-; E_COMPILE_WARNING - compile-time warnings (non-fatal errors)
-; E_USER_ERROR      - user-generated error message
-; E_USER_WARNING    - user-generated warning message
-; E_USER_NOTICE     - user-generated notice message
-; E_DEPRECATED      - warn about code that will not work in future versions
-;                     of PHP
-; E_USER_DEPRECATED - user-generated deprecation warnings
-;
-; Common Values:
-;   E_ALL (Show all errors, warnings and notices including coding standards.)
-;   E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE  (Show all errors, except for notices)
-;   E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT  (Show all errors, except for notices and coding standards warnings.)
-;   E_COMPILE_ERROR|E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR|E_ERROR|E_CORE_ERROR  (Show only errors)
-; Default Value: E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED
-; Development Value: E_ALL
-; Production Value: E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
-; http://php.net/error-reporting
-error_reporting = E_ALL
-
-; This directive controls whether or not and where PHP will output errors,
-; notices and warnings too. Error output is very useful during development, but
-; it could be very dangerous in production environments. Depending on the code
-; which is triggering the error, sensitive information could potentially leak
-; out of your application such as database usernames and passwords or worse.
-; It's recommended that errors be logged on production servers rather than
-; having the errors sent to STDOUT.
-; Possible Values:
-;   Off = Do not display any errors
-;   stderr = Display errors to STDERR (affects only CGI/CLI binaries!)
-;   On or stdout = Display errors to STDOUT
-; Default Value: On
-; Development Value: On
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/display-errors
-display_errors = On
-
-; The display of errors which occur during PHP's startup sequence are handled
-; separately from display_errors. PHP's default behavior is to suppress those
-; errors from clients. Turning the display of startup errors on can be useful in
-; debugging configuration problems. But, it's strongly recommended that you
-; leave this setting off on production servers.
-; Default Value: Off
-; Development Value: On
-; Production Value: Off
-; http://php.net/display-startup-errors
-display_startup_errors = Off
-
-; Besides displaying errors, PHP can also log errors to locations such as a

-; This directive determines which super global arrays are registered when PHP

-; This directive determines whether PHP registers $argv & $argc each time it

-; is invoked. $argc contains an integer representing the number of arguments
-; that were passed when the script was invoked. These arrays are extremely
-; useful when running scripts from the command line. When this directive is

-; variable in order to use PHP's session functions.
-;
-; The path can be defined as:
-;
-;     session.save_path = "N;/path"
-;
-; where N is an integer.  Instead of storing all the session files in
-; /path, what this will do is use subdirectories N-levels deep, and
-; store the session data in those directories.  This is useful if you
-; or your OS have problems with lots of files in one directory, and is
-; a more efficient layout for servers that handle lots of sessions.
-;
-; NOTE 1: PHP will not create this directory structure automatically.
-;         You can use the script in the ext/session dir for that purpose.
-; NOTE 2: See the section on garbage collection below if you choose to
-;         use subdirectories for session storage

-################################## NETWORK #####################################
-
-# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
-# for connections from all the network interfaces available on the server.
-# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
-# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
-#
-# Examples:
-#
-# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
-# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
-#
-# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
-# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
-# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
-# following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only into
-# the IPv4 lookback interface address (this means Redis will be able to
-# accept connections only from clients running into the same computer it
-# is running).
-#
-# IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
-# JUST COMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
-# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-# bind 127.0.0.1
-
-
-# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
-# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.

-# When protected mode is on and if:
-#
-# 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
-#    "bind" directive.
-# 2) No password is configured.
-#
-# The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
-# IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
-# sockets.
-#
-# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if

-################################# REPLICATION #################################
-
-# Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of
-# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
-#
-# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
-#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
-#    a given number of slaves.
-# 2) Redis slaves are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
-#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
-#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
-#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
-# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
-#    network partition slaves automatically try to reconnect to masters
-#    and resynchronize with them.
-#
-# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>
-
-# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
-# directive below) it is possible to tell the slave to authenticate before
-# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
-# refuse the slave request.
-#
-# masterauth <master-password>
-requirepass "04221021.."
-
-# When a slave loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
-# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:
-#
-# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will
-#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
-#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
-#
-# 2) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with
-#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
-#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.
-#
-slave-serve-stale-data yes
-
-# You can configure a slave instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
-# a slave instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
-# written on a slave will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
-# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
-# misconfiguration.
-#
-# Since Redis 2.6 by default slaves are read-only.
-#
-# Note: read only slaves are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
-# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
-# Still a read only slave exports by default all the administrative commands
-# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
-# security of read only slaves using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
-# administrative / dangerous commands.
-slave-read-only yes
-
-# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
-#
-# -------------------------------------------------------
-# WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY
-# -------------------------------------------------------
-#
-# New slaves and reconnecting slaves that are not able to continue the replication
-# process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full
-# synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the slaves.
-# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
-#
-# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
-#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
-#                 process to the slaves incrementally.
-# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
-#              RDB file to slave sockets, without touching the disk at all.
-#
-# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more slaves
-# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing
-# the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once
-# the transfer starts, new slaves arriving will be queued and a new transfer
-# will start when the current one terminates.
-#
-# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
-# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple slaves
-# will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
-#
-# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
-# works better.
-repl-diskless-sync no
-
-# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
-# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
-# to the slaves.
-#
-# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
-# new slaves arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server
-# waits a delay in order to let more slaves arrive.
-#
-# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
-# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
-repl-diskless-sync-delay 5
-
-# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
-# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10
-# seconds.
-#
-# repl-ping-slave-period 10
-
-# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
-#
-# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of slave.
-# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of slaves (data, pings).
-# 3) Slave timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
-#
-# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
-# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
-# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.
-#
-# repl-timeout 60
-
-# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the slave socket after SYNC?
-#
-# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
-# less bandwidth to send data to slaves. But this can add a delay for
-# the data to appear on the slave side, up to 40 milliseconds with
-# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
-#
-# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the slave side will
-# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
-#
-# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
-# or when the master and slaves are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
-# be a good idea.
-repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no
-
-# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
-# slave data when slaves are disconnected for some time, so that when a slave
-# wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial
-# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the slave missed while
-# disconnected.
-#
-# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the slave can be
-# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
-#
-# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a slave connected.
-#
-# repl-backlog-size 1mb
-
-# After a master has no longer connected slaves for some time, the backlog
-# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
-# need to elapse, starting from the time the last slave disconnected, for
-# the backlog buffer to be freed.
-#
-# Note that slaves never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be
-# promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly "partially
-# resynchronize" with the slaves: hence they should always accumulate backlog.
-#
-# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
-#
-# repl-backlog-ttl 3600
-
-# The slave priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.
-# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a slave to promote into a
-# master if the master is no longer working correctly.
-#
-# A slave with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
-# for instance if there are three slaves with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
-# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
-#
-# However a special priority of 0 marks the slave as not able to perform the
-# role of master, so a slave with priority of 0 will never be selected by
-# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
-#
-# By default the priority is 100.
-slave-priority 100
-
-# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
-# N slaves connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
-#
-# The N slaves need to be in "online" state.
-#
-# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
-# the last ping received from the slave, that is usually sent every second.
-#
-# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
-# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough slaves
-# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
-#
-# For example to require at least 3 slaves with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
-#
-# min-slaves-to-write 3
-# min-slaves-max-lag 10
-#
-# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
-#
-# By default min-slaves-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
-# min-slaves-max-lag is set to 10.
-
-# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
-# slaves in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
-# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
-# Redis Sentinel in order to discover slave instances.
-# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
-# "ROLE" command of a master.
-#
-# The listed IP and address normally reported by a slave is obtained
-# in the following way:
-#
-#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
-#   of the socket used by the slave to connect with the master.
-#
-#   Port: The port is communicated by the slave during the replication
-#   handshake, and is normally the port that the slave is using to
-#   list for connections.
-#
-# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
-# used, the slave may be actually reachable via different IP and port
-# pairs. The following two options can be used by a slave in order to
-# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
-# and ROLE will report those values.
-#
-# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
-# the port or the IP address.
-#
-# slave-announce-ip 5.5.5.5

-# an error 'max number of clients reached'.

-############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################
-
-# Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.
-# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
-# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
-#
-# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
-# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
-# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
-# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
-#
-# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to
-# set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
-#
-# WARNING: If you have slaves attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
-# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the slaves are subtracted
-# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
-# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
-# buffer of slaves is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
-# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
-#
-# In short... if you have slaves attached it is suggested that you set a lower
-# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for slave
-# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
-#
-# maxmemory <bytes>
-
-# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
-# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
-#
-# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU among the keys with an expire set.
-# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
-# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU among the keys with an expire set.
-# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
-# volatile-random -> Remove a random key among the ones with an expire set.
-# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
-# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
-# noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
-#
-# LRU means Least Recently Used
-# LFU means Least Frequently Used
-#
-# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
-# randomized algorithms.
-#
-# Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write
-#       operations, when there are no suitable keys for eviction.
-#
-#       At the date of writing these commands are: set setnx setex append
-#       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd
-#       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby
-#       zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby
-#       getset mset msetnx exec sort
-#
-# The default is:
-#
-# maxmemory-policy noeviction
-
-# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
-# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
-# accuracy. For default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
-# used less recently, you can change the sample size using the following
-# configuration directive.
-#
-# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
-# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.
-#

-############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################
-
-# Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking
-# deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands
-# in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous
-# way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed
-# in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other
-# O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an
-# aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for
-# a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.
-#
-# For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives
-# such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and
-# FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands
-# are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the
-# object in the background as fast as possible.
-#
-# DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.
-# It's up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good
-# idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to
-# delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.
-# Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the
-# following scenarios:
-#
-# 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,
-#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified
-#    memory limit.
-# 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the
-#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.
-# 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may
-#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key
-#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE
-#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command
-#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace
-#    it with the specified string.
-# 4) During replication, when a slave performs a full resynchronization with
-#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to
-#    load the RDB file just transfered.
-#
-# In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,
-# like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically
-# in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK
-# was called, using the following configuration directives:
-
-lazyfree-lazy-eviction no
-lazyfree-lazy-expire no
-lazyfree-lazy-server-del no
-slave-lazy-flush no

-############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################
-
-# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
-# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
-# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
-# the configured save points).
-#
-# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
-# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
-# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
-# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
-# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
-# still running correctly.
-#
-# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
-# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
-# with the better durability guarantees.
-#
-# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.
-
-appendonly no
-
-# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")
-
-appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
-
-# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
-# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
-# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
-#
-# Redis supports three different modes:
-#
-# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
-# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
-# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
-#
-# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
-# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
-# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
-# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
-# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
-# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
-# everysec.
-#
-# More details please check the following article:
-# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
-#
-# If unsure, use "everysec".
-
-# appendfsync always
-appendfsync everysec
-# appendfsync no
-
-# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
-# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
-# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
-# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
-# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
-# our synchronous write(2) call.
-#
-# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
-# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
-# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
-#
-# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
-# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
-# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
-# default Linux settings).
-#
-# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
-# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

-no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no
-
-# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
-# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
-# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
-#
-# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
-# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
-# the AOF at startup is used).
-#
-# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
-# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
-# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
-# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
-# is reached but it is still pretty small.
-#
-# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
-# rewrite feature.
-
-auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
-auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb
-
-# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
-# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
-# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
-# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
-# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
-# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
-#
-# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
-# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
-# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
-#
-# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
-# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
-# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
-# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
-# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
-# the server.
-#
-# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
-# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
-# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
-# will be found.
-aof-load-truncated yes
-
-# When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the
-# AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned
-# on the rewritten AOF file is composed of two different stanzas:
-#
-#   [RDB file][AOF tail]
-#
-# When loading Redis recognizes that the AOF file starts with the "REDIS"
-# string and loads the prefixed RDB file, and continues loading the AOF
-# tail.
-#
-# This is currently turned off by default in order to avoid the surprise
-# of a format change, but will at some point be used as the default.

-# When a long running script exceeds the maximum execution time only the

-################################ REDIS CLUSTER  ###############################
-#
-# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-# WARNING EXPERIMENTAL: Redis Cluster is considered to be stable code, however
-# in order to mark it as "mature" we need to wait for a non trivial percentage
-# of users to deploy it in production.
-# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-#
-# Normal Redis instances can't be part of a Redis Cluster; only nodes that are
-# started as cluster nodes can. In order to start a Redis instance as a
-# cluster node enable the cluster support uncommenting the following:
-#
-# cluster-enabled yes
-
-# Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not
-# intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.
-# Every Redis Cluster node requires a different cluster configuration file.
-# Make sure that instances running in the same system do not have
-# overlapping cluster configuration file names.
-#
-# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf
-
-# Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable
-# for it to be considered in failure state.
-# Most other internal time limits are multiple of the node timeout.
-#
-# cluster-node-timeout 15000
-
-# A slave of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
-# looks too old.
-#
-# There is no simple way for a slave to actually have an exact measure of
-# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
-#
-# 1) If there are multiple slaves able to failover, they exchange messages
-#    in order to try to give an advantage to the slave with the best
-#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
-#    Slaves will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
-#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
-#
-# 2) Every single slave computes the time of the last interaction with
-#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
-#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
-#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
-#    If the last interaction is too old, the slave will not try to failover
-#    at all.
-#
-# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a slave will not perform
-# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
-# elapsed is greater than:
-#
-#   (node-timeout * slave-validity-factor) + repl-ping-slave-period
-#
-# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the slave-validity-factor
-# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-slave-period of 10 seconds, the
-# slave will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
-# for longer than 310 seconds.
-#
-# A large slave-validity-factor may allow slaves with too old data to failover
-# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
-# elect a slave at all.
-#
-# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the slave-validity-factor
-# to a value of 0, which means, that slaves will always try to failover the
-# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
-# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
-# offset rank).
-#
-# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
-# the cluster will always be able to continue.
-#
-# cluster-slave-validity-factor 10
-
-# Cluster slaves are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
-# that are left without working slaves. This improves the cluster ability
-# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
-# in case of failure if it has no working slaves.
-#
-# Slaves migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
-# given number of other working slaves for their old master. This number
-# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a slave
-# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working slave for its master
-# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of slaves you want for every
-# master in your cluster.
-#
-# Default is 1 (slaves migrate only if their masters remain with at least
-# one slave). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.
-# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
-# in production.
-#
-# cluster-migration-barrier 1
-
-# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
-# is at least an hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
-# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
-# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
-# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
-#
-# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
-# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
-# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
-# option to no.
-#
-# cluster-require-full-coverage yes
-
-# This option, when set to yes, prevents slaves from trying to failover its
-# master during master failures. However the master can still perform a
-# manual failover, if forced to do so.
-#
-# This is useful in different scenarios, especially in the case of multiple
-# data center operations, where we want one side to never be promoted if not
-# in the case of a total DC failure.
-#
-# cluster-slave-no-failover no
-
-# In order to setup your cluster make sure to read the documentation
-# available at http://redis.io web site.

-########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################
-
-# In certain deployments, Redis Cluster nodes address discovery fails, because
-# addresses are NAT-ted or because ports are forwarded (the typical case is
-# Docker and other containers).
-#
-# In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static
-# configuration where each node knows its public address is needed. The
-# following two options are used for this scope, and are:
-#
-# * cluster-announce-ip
-# * cluster-announce-port
-# * cluster-announce-bus-port
-#
-# Each instruct the node about its address, client port, and cluster message
-# bus port. The information is then published in the header of the bus packets
-# so that other nodes will be able to correctly map the address of the node
-# publishing the information.
-#
-# If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection
-# will be used instead.
-#
-# Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of
-# clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending
-# on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of
-# 10000 will be used as usually.
-#
-# Example:
-#
-# cluster-announce-ip 10.1.1.5
-# cluster-announce-port 6379
-# cluster-announce-bus-port 6380
-
-################################## SLOW LOG ###################################
-
-# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
-# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
-# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
-# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
-# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
-# other requests in the meantime).
-#
-# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
-# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
-# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
-# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
-# queue of logged commands.
-
-# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
-# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
-# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
-slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

-# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
-# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.

-################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################
-
-# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
-# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
-# latency of a Redis instance.
-#
-# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
-# print graphs and obtain reports.
-#
-# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
-# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
-# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
-# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
-#
-# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
-# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
-# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
-# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
-# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.
-latency-monitor-threshold 0
-
-############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################
-
-# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
-# This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications
-#
-# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
-# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
-# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
-#
-# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
-# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
-#
-# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
-# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
-#
-#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
-#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
-#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
-#  $     String commands
-#  l     List commands
-#  s     Set commands
-#  h     Hash commands
-#  z     Sorted set commands
-#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
-#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
-#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the "AKE" string means all the events.
-#
-#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
-#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
-#  are disabled.
-#
-#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
-#           event name, use:
-#
-#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
-#
-#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
-#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
-#
-#  notify-keyspace-events Ex
-#
-#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
-#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
-#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.

-# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
-# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
-# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)
-# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
-# that is rehashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
-# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
-# by the hash table.
-#
-# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
-# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
-#
-# If unsure:
-# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
-# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
-# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
-#
-# use "activerehashing yes" if you don't have such hard requirements but
-# want to free memory asap when possible.

-# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
-# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
-# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
-# publisher can produce them).
-#
-# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
-#
-# normal -> normal clients including MONITOR clients
-# slave  -> slave clients
-# pubsub -> clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
-#
-# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
-#
-# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>
-#
-# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
-# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
-# seconds (continuously).
-# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
-# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
-# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
-# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
-# the limit for 10 seconds.
-#
-# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
-# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
-# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
-# than it can read.
-#
-# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and slave clients, since
-# subscribers and slaves receive data in a push fashion.
-#
-# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.

-client-output-buffer-limit pubsub 32mb 8mb 60
-
-# Client query buffers accumulate new commands. They are limited to a fixed
-# amount by default in order to avoid that a protocol desynchronization (for
-# instance due to a bug in the client) will lead to unbound memory usage in
-# the query buffer. However you can configure it here if you have very special
-# needs, such us huge multi/exec requests or alike.

-
-# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like
-# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are
-# never requested, and so forth.
-#
-# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for
-# tasks to perform according to the specified "hz" value.
-#
-# By default "hz" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when
-# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when
-# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be
-# handled with more precision.
-#
-# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not

-# Redis LFU eviction (see maxmemory setting) can be tuned. However it is a good
-# idea to start with the default settings and only change them after investigating
-# how to improve the performances and how the keys LFU change over time, which
-# is possible to inspect via the OBJECT FREQ command.
-#
-# There are two tunable parameters in the Redis LFU implementation: the
-# counter logarithm factor and the counter decay time. It is important to
-# understand what the two parameters mean before changing them.
-#
-# The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it's maximum value is 255, so Redis
-# uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value
-# of the old counter, when a key is accessed, the counter is incremented in
-# this way:
-#
-# 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.
-# 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).
-# 3. The counter is incremented only if R < P.
-#
-# The default lfu-log-factor is 10. This is a table of how the frequency
-# counter changes with a different number of accesses with different
-# logarithmic factors:
-#
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | factor | 100 hits   | 1000 hits  | 100K hits  | 1M hits    | 10M hits   |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | 0      | 104        | 255        | 255        | 255        | 255        |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | 1      | 18         | 49         | 255        | 255        | 255        |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
-# | 10     | 10         | 18         | 142        | 255        | 255        |

-# | 100    | 8          | 11         | 49         | 143        | 255        |
-# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+

-# NOTE: The above table was obtained by running the following commands:
-#
-#   redis-benchmark -n 1000000 incr foo
-#   redis-cli object freq foo
-#
-# NOTE 2: The counter initial value is 5 in order to give new objects a chance
-# to accumulate hits.
-#
-# The counter decay time is the time, in minutes, that must elapse in order
-# for the key counter to be divided by two (or decremented if it has a value
-# less <= 10).
-#
-# The default value for the lfu-decay-time is 1. A Special value of 0 means to

-########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################
-#
-# WARNING THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL. However it was stress tested
-# even in production and manually tested by multiple engineers for some
-# time.
-#
-# What is active defragmentation?
-# -------------------------------
-#
-# Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the
-# spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,
-# thus allowing to reclaim back memory.
-#
-# Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but
-# less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server
-# restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush
-# away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature
-# implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime
-# in an "hot" way, while the server is running.
-#
-# Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the
-# configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the
-# values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc
-# features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation
-# and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the
-# old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys
-# will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.
-#
-# Important things to understand:
-#
-# 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis
-#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.
-#    This is the default with Linux builds.
-#
-# 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don't have fragmentation
-#    issues.
-#
-# 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when
-#    needed with the command "CONFIG SET activedefrag yes".
-#
-# The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the
-# defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is
-# a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.
-
-# Enabled active defragmentation
